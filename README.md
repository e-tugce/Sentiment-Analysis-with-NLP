# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python project for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model predicts the sentiment of restaurant reviews as positive or negative.  
Includes data preprocessing, text vectorization, and performance evaluation using Python and scikit-learn. 

Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is the dataset containing restaurant reviews and their sentiments.
